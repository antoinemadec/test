#!/usr/bin/env lua

-- You should avoid identifiers starting with an underscore followed by one or
-- more uppercase letters (e.g., _VERSION); they are reserved for special uses
-- in Lua. Usually, I reserve the identifier _ (a single underscore) for a
-- dummy variable.

-- The following words are reserved; we cannot use them as identifiers:
--     and       break     do        else      elseif
--     end       false     for       function  if
--     in        local     nil       not       or
--     repeat    return    then      true      until
--     while

-- Lua is case-sensitive: and is a reserved word, but And and AND are two other
-- different identifiers.
